  #  Data Collection:
  Obtain the Titanic dataset, which is available on various platforms, including Kaggle. You can download the dataset from the following link: Titanic Dataset.

  #  Data Exploration:
  Explore the dataset to gain insights into the available features and their distributions. Understand the meaning of each column and identify any missing values that need to be addressed during data preprocessing.

  #  Data Preprocessing:
  Preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and convert categorical variables into numerical representations that can be used by machine learning models. This step may involve techniques such as imputation, one-hot encoding, or label encoding.

  #  Feature Engineering: 
  Create new features or transform existing ones to capture meaningful information. For example, you could extract titles from passenger names or create a new feature indicating whether a passenger is traveling alone or with family members.

   # Data Splitting:
   Split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the machine learning model. Typically, the dataset is divided into a training set (used for model training) and a testing set (used for model evaluation).

 #   Model Selection:
 Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for classification. Common choices include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting algorithms. Consider the trade-off between interpretability and performance.

  #  Model Training: 
  Train the selected model using the training data. Adjust the hyperparameters of the model to optimize its performance. This step may involve techniques such as cross-validation or grid search to find the best set of hyperparameters.

 #   Model Evaluation: 
 Evaluate the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC). These metrics will help you assess the performance of the model in predicting survival outcomes.

  #  Model Deployment: 
  Deploy the trained model into a production environment or use it to make predictions on new, unseen data. Ensure the system is scalable, efficient, and able to handle incoming passenger information effectively.

  #  Monitoring and Iteration:
  Continuously monitor the performance of the deployed model and collect feedback to make improvements. Update the model periodically to adapt to changes in passenger demographics or to incorporate new features.
